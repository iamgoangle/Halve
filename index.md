# About Me

Hey dude! you know me? I think not. I am Teerapong Singthong, you can call me 'Golf'. I am a Analyst Programmer, but I don't like this job title :( so please thinking and expecting about me in part of  'Software Developer' instead. I am living in Thailand. I have been working on web technology for a few year.

This github page is created for keep-and-share what I am interesting.

Chelsea fan, DC - Marvel lover, Biker, Fast walker, Beef lover, Loving in design and more...
