# About Me

I am Teerapong Singthong, you can call me 'Golf'. I am a Analyst Programmer, but I don't like this job title :( so please thinking and expecting me in part of  'Software Developer' instead. I am living in Thailand. I have been working on web technology for a few year.

This github page is created for keep-and-share what I am interesting.
